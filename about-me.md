## EXPERIENCE

### Sr. Assoc. Image Science Engineering, L3Harris, Cincinnati, Ohio

*June 2022 - Present*

-**AI/ML MLOps pipeline:**

- Developed MLOps features for ML model training experiments, results/metric tracking, and Data Version Control.
- Developed open-source tools including MLFlow tracking server/repository and Data Version Control (DVC) registry.
- Integrated and tested primary AI/ML object detection, classification, and reidentification models.

-**Fusion Demo:**

- Executed MLOps pipeline to deliver fine-tuned object detection models to the Fusion effort.
- Conducted two iterations of the MLOps pipeline, including raw data preprocessing, data cataloguing, staging for labeling effort, generation of object detection ground truth, model training, and delivery of ONNX model to Fusion team.

-**Model-Assisted Labeling containerized workflow:**

- Developed CI/CD pipeline to utilize pretrained object detection models for generating pre-labels to increase efficiency of labeling effort.
- Developed containerized query/inference/export python scripts to auto-generate model predictions and export to Labelbox (Labeling tool).
- Conducted research into SOTA non-real-time large object detection models.

### Image Science Engineer Co-op, L3Harris, Cincinnati, Ohio

*January 2021 - August 2021*

-**Development of Image Ground Truth Data labeling tool:**

- Developed a Python (PyQt5) application to gather object tracking and detection data, with a user interface allowing hand annotation of images and various automation features.
- Conducted research and development of image processing algorithms, including template matching.
- Implemented Convolutional Neural Network for Object detection (Yolov5).
